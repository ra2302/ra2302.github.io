### What's next?
- I have been tinkering with Malware Analysis(Following proper course!) and Threat Intelligence. I have interesting data that I have collected and working on. Will be publishing the findings soon!  
- Learning Kibana and Elasticseach in the process as these are the tools I had my eyes on next. 
- My main aim as of now is to become a better Blue Teamer.  

I have formed a well routine lately and will continue to publish periodically. Will not disappoint meself. I'd like this blog to be a display of the progress and my commitment.
