Hi! I am a full time SOC Analyst at a MNC. I'm still at the very beginning of my career and still very much new to the landscape. 
I'm a proactive learner and a cyber security professional and with the help of this blog, I'll be showcasing the same. So welcome to my journey! Where I'll sharpen my blades build my arsenal.

The aim of this blog is to showcase my abilities and a method for me take a note of my progress and share my knowledge with the awesome community of cybersecurity! 

Happy Defending!(And attacking! ;D)
