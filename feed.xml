The scenario goes something like this - A critical alert was detected on Health Sphere Systems’ database server. The security controls are still being established so the alerts have only come from the server. We’re supposed to manually correlate and investigate the servers and workstations to understand the incident. The alert w... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Five - My Lab :D</title><link href="https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Five.One-My-Lab/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Five - My Lab :D" /><published>2025-09-14T01:00:00+05:30</published> <updated>2025-12-31T13:01:28+05:30</updated> <id>https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Five.One-My-Lab/</id> <content src="https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Five.One-My-Lab/" /> <author> <name>Ra2302</name> </author> <category term="Days of Security" /> <category term="research" /> <category term="malware" /> <summary> Intro Hello! Welcome to the introduction of my lab environment! Each and every aspect was enabled and created after months of working on live samples. First off I’ll explain my Malware analysis lab. It is quite straight forward but has minute details. All the diagram and screenshots are my own Malware Analysis Lab To begin with, I am using FlareVM by Mandiant. I did a minimal install due to... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Seven - Malware Analysis - Multi-Stage PureHVNC RAT - Part of PXAStealer</title><link href="https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Seven-PureHVNC-Dropper/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Seven - Malware Analysis - Multi-Stage PureHVNC RAT - Part of PXAStealer" /><published>2025-08-06T01:00:00+05:30</published> <updated>2025-08-21T20:36:42+05:30</updated> <id>https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Seven-PureHVNC-Dropper/</id> <content src="https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Seven-PureHVNC-Dropper/" /> <author> <name>Ra2302</name> </author> <category term="Days of Security" /> <category term="Reverse Engineering" /> <category term="Incident Response" /> <category term="Malware Analysis" /> <summary> Intro This piece of malware was spotted in one of the incident for which I led the response. It was executed, undetected by Defender for Endpoint and garned a full fledged IR investigation. I will not mention the whole IR process as this focuses more on the analysis of the dropper which was a multi-stage heavily obfucated python script &amp;amp; C# binary. To give more context to it. It was a PXASt... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Six - TryHackMe - IronShade Linux Forensics Challenge</title><link href="https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Six-Linux-Forensics-IronShade/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Six - TryHackMe - IronShade Linux Forensics Challenge" /><published>2025-07-21T01:00:00+05:30</published> <updated>2025-08-09T23:01:37+05:30</updated> <id>https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Six-Linux-Forensics-IronShade/</id> <content src="https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Six-Linux-Forensics-IronShade/" /> <author> <name>Ra2302</name> </author> <category term="Days of Security" /> <category term="Digital Forensics" /> <category term="Linux" /> <category term="TryHackMe" /> <summary> Intro IronShade is a medium difficulty linux forensics challenge. The story goes something like this - we’ve setup a honeypot and have intentionally exposed a weak SSH and other ports to get attacked by an attacker. One such honeypot was compromised and now we’re supposed to analyse what steps did the attacker take to compromise the machine and maintain persistence. Although it is a medium diff... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Four - TryHackMe - Diskrupt Forensics Challenge</title><link href="https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Four-Diskrupt-THM/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Four - TryHackMe - Diskrupt Forensics Challenge" /><published>2025-07-13T01:00:00+05:30</published> <updated>2025-07-13T18:49:01+05:30</updated> <id>https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Four-Diskrupt-THM/</id> <content src="https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Four-Diskrupt-THM/" /> <author> <name>Ra2302</name> </author> <category term="Days of Security" /> <category term="Digital Forensics" /> <category term="Incident Response" /> <category term="TryHackMe" /> <summary> Intro Diskrupt is a hard difficulty digital forensics challenge. The main objective is to fix the damaged disk, analyse the file system, and recover the deleted files. There are 12 questions as part of this challenge. My goal here is not to provide a walkthrough but to demonstrate my capabilities and my thought process so there might be some rambling and side-tracks here. We’re provided with a... </summary> </entry> </feed>
