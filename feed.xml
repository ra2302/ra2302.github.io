It was executed, undetected by Defender for Endpoint and garned a full fledged IR investigation. I will not mention the whole IR process as this focuses more on the analysis of the dropper which was a multi-stage heavily obfucated python script &amp;amp; C# binary. To give more context to it. It was a PXASt... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Six - TryHackMe - IronShade Linux Forensics Challenge</title><link href="https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Six-Linux-Forensics-IronShade/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Six - TryHackMe - IronShade Linux Forensics Challenge" /><published>2025-07-21T01:00:00+05:30</published> <updated>2025-08-09T23:01:37+05:30</updated> <id>https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Six-Linux-Forensics-IronShade/</id> <content src="https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Six-Linux-Forensics-IronShade/" /> <author> <name>Ra2302</name> </author> <category term="Days of Security" /> <category term="Digital Forensics" /> <category term="Linux" /> <category term="TryHackMe" /> <summary> Intro IronShade is a medium difficulty linux forensics challenge. The story goes something like this - we’ve setup a honeypot and have intentionally exposed a weak SSH and other ports to get attacked by an attacker. One such honeypot was compromised and now we’re supposed to analyse what steps did the attacker take to compromise the machine and maintain persistence. Although it is a medium diff... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Four - TryHackMe - Diskrupt Forensics Challenge</title><link href="https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Four-Diskrupt-THM/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Four - TryHackMe - Diskrupt Forensics Challenge" /><published>2025-07-13T01:00:00+05:30</published> <updated>2025-07-13T18:49:01+05:30</updated> <id>https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Four-Diskrupt-THM/</id> <content src="https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Four-Diskrupt-THM/" /> <author> <name>Ra2302</name> </author> <category term="Days of Security" /> <category term="Digital Forensics" /> <category term="Incident Response" /> <category term="TryHackMe" /> <summary> Intro Diskrupt is a hard difficulty digital forensics challenge. The main objective is to fix the damaged disk, analyse the file system, and recover the deleted files. There are 12 questions as part of this challenge. My goal here is not to provide a walkthrough but to demonstrate my capabilities and my thought process so there might be some rambling and side-tracks here. We’re provided with a... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Three - PMAT Lab - Bonus Binary Malware Analysis</title><link href="https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Three-ImageExfil-PMAT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Three - PMAT Lab - Bonus Binary Malware Analysis" /><published>2024-11-02T01:00:00+05:30</published> <updated>2024-11-02T01:00:00+05:30</updated> <id>https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Three-ImageExfil-PMAT/</id> <content src="https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Three-ImageExfil-PMAT/" /> <author> <name>Ra2302</name> </author> <category term="Days of Security" /> <category term="Malware Analysis" /> <category term="PMAT" /> <summary> Intro So with my time being completely MIA and being lazy, I just want to mention that I was learning Malware Analysis and I have gained somewhat of a foothold in the same. This blog is just to highlight the same and share the first report that I wrote for a binary. Albeit it was a sample binary which is a part of the Practical Malware Analysis course from TCM Security. I still feel that it is ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Two - LetsDefend - PCAP Analysis Challenge</title><link href="https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Two-PCAP-Analysis/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Two - LetsDefend - PCAP Analysis Challenge" /><published>2024-02-27T22:00:00+05:30</published> <updated>2025-07-13T18:44:52+05:30</updated> <id>https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Two-PCAP-Analysis/</id> <content src="https://ra2302.github.io/posts/Two-PCAP-Analysis/" /> <author> <name>Ra2302</name> </author> <category term="LetsDefend" /> <category term="Days of Security" /> <summary> Intro PCAP Analysis Challenge is a relatively easy challenge where we’re provided with logs from P13’s computer and we’re supposed to answer the questions. PCAP? What is that? PCAP stands for packet capture. This blog is made up of many small packets which were transmitted to your system when you entered the URL and pressed enter. A packet capture file basically captures all the traffic(or pac... </summary> </entry> </feed>
