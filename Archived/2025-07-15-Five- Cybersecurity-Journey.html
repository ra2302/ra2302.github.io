<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>The previous 5th blog felt so insignificant that I couldn’t get myself to write it for nearly a month. It was a pentest report for the TryHackMe - Red Team Capstone Challenge. Instead here’s a link to my <a href="https://tryhackme.com/p/ra23o2">profile</a>.</p>

<p>So utilizing that opportunity, I am just here to mention what’s next. In the future, expect articles on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Malware development</li>
  <li>Reverse Engineering &amp; Malware Analysis</li>
  <li>Azure Security</li>
  <li>What I’ll develop and analyse, I will execute it in my Azure Lab and work through the forensics and Incident response of it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other than that, I do wish to indulge in Threat Intelligence side of things. I will try to delve into that wherever possible.</p>

<p>And one last thing, I am open to work! Feel free to reach out to me on my email/linkedin for the same!</p>
