## Intro
The previous 5th blog felt so insignificant that I couldn't get myself to write it for nearly a month. It was a pentest report for the TryHackMe - Red Team Capstone Challenge. Instead here's a link to my [profile](https://tryhackme.com/p/ra23o2). 

So utilizing that opportunity, I am just here to mention what's next. In the future, expect articles on:  
- Malware development
- Reverse Engineering & Malware Analysis
- Azure Security
- What I'll develop and analyse, I will execute it in my Azure Lab and work through the forensics and Incident response of it.

Other than that, I do wish to indulge in Threat Intelligence side of things. I will try to delve into that wherever possible.    

And one last thing, I am open to work! Feel free to reach out to me on my email/linkedin for the same!
